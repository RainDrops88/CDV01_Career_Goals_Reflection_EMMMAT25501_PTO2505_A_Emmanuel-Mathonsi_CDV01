### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - Complete Software Development course, this will offer me the exposure to the tech environment and a great understanding of how the web and software are created and how they function.
    - Learn other programming languages, such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL, as the tech environment evolves around these languages. Understanding them gives you the power to manipulate and protect them effectively.



2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Achieve deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, OOP, and software design patterns, These are foundational to help me write efficient, scalable, and maintainable code in any language or framework.

    - Develop at least 3–5 substantial personal or open-source projects. Real-world projects demonstrate your abilities far better than just a resume or certification. They also reinforce learning by doing.

    - Make regular contributions to open-source projects (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), build collaboration skills, credibility, and expose yourself to large codebases and professional development workflows.

    - Become proficient in unit testing, integration testing, and debugging techniques. Tech evolves rapidly. Lifelong learning is critical to help me stay relevant and competitive.

    - Gain proficiency with Git, GitHub, and exposure to CI/CD pipelines and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. Writing testable, reliable code is a mark of a professional developer that I aspire to be. These are essential tools in modern software development and deployment.

    - Secure my first professional role and aim to become a mid-level developer within 2–3 years. Practical experience is one of the most powerful learning tools and growth accelerators I need.



### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:

    - Use a planner or calendar to block study sessions, having a consistent routine that avoids burnout and promotes my daily learning.

    - Solving 2–3 coding challenges/week per language, it will help me gain functional knowledge of at least 2–3 beginner-level projects in each language.


2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Study one major concept every month ( arrays & strings, recursion, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms). These are critical for writing optimized, maintainable, and scalable code, and are commonly tested in technical interviews.

    - Choose diverse project types ( web app, REST API, automation script, mobile app) and document each project (README, tech stack, challenges faced, what I learned). Projects are proof of skill, boost confidence, and serve as excellent material for interviews and portfolios.

    - Start with beginner-friendly repos, Contribute through bug fixes, documentation, or adding small features, and Learn Git workflows (branching, pull requests, code reviews). Building teamwork will expose me to real-world collaboration tools and large codebases, and make me visible to the developer community.

    - Learn tools such as Jest (JavaScript), PyTest (Python), or JUnit (Java) and practice debugging with IDEs. learning these tools will ensures my code reliability, and debugging is key to solving complex problems efficiently.

    - Commit to practising Git daily and Learn CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI. These tools are the backbone of modern development and deployment pipelines.

    - Prepare my CV, GitHub, and LinkedIn with all completed projects, apply to entry-level, internship, and freelance roles, practice technical and behavioural interview questions while seeking mentorship, and keep track of professional feedback.


### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Time management with other responsibilities, for instance, work and family, setting a fixed weekly schedule and breaking the course into smaller milestones will be the strategy I use to overcome.

    - Technical content might feel overwhelming; therefore, joining online forums or peer study groups for support.

    - Syntax differences and paradigms across languages will therefore be considered when learning one language at a time, using project-based learning to stay focused.

    - Abstract concepts can be hard to grasp without real use. Practising daily to build problem-solving skills.

    - Self-doubt or fear of publishing unfinished code would break projects into smaller milestones using Agile boards (GitHub Projects).

    - Lack of feedback or motivation without deadlines.

    - Finding beginner-friendly projects.

    - Breaking into the industry without prior experience.



2. **Opportunities for Growth**:
    
    - CodeSpace Academy have exposed me to vast platforms of coding, which increases the opportunities for growth and development in the field.

    - Learning to face or deal with every challenge I face on the field will enhance my skills, as challenges are the ones that help advance/expand knowledge in every field.

    - The Tech industry is more diverse, joining online forums and support groups will offer me a room for learning new skills and ideas, and keep me up to date, as there are always new features and better ways of solving problems.
